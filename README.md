# Object-Detection-using-YOLO-v4-

### Introduction

The following 2 models are used for detecting various objects. One model is used to detect objects in a static image, whereas the second model gives real-time detection from a video clip.

### Libraries used

Both these models were almost completely implemented using the OpenCV library. We also used the matplotlib library to plot static images and the various detection boxes on our images and videos.

### Model used

We implemented the models using the YOLO v4 pre-trained neural network model which we downloaded from the darknet repository by AlexeyAB. The link to the model can be found (here)[https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet].

### Dataset used

Both the image and video used in my models have been uploaded to the repository.
